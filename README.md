How to use:
1. Unzip and open index.html (or deploy to Vercel).
2. Replace images/1.jpg ... images/13.jpg with your photos.
3. Replace videos/1.gif ... videos/5.gif with real mp4 files if you have them;
   update script.js slide building logic if you want actual <video> tags.
4. Controls: Arrow keys, Prev/Next buttons, Space to play/pause.
5. Captions are auto-generated; edit script.js to change text.

Notes:
- This package uses animated GIFs as video placeholders. Replace with mp4 for real videos.
- The UI is optimized for iPad and desktop. For mobile tweaks, adjust CSS media queries.
